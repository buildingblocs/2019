Participants are first advised to **go through the lessons** materials posted at their own convenience. A **Q&A session** will then be held **weekly at *ClassDo*** by the respective speakers to help clarify participants’ doubts of the particular week’s topic.
An invitation link to the *ClassDo* session would be emailed to participants as well as posted onto the website before the week’s session. Learn more about the *ClassDo* Sessions <a href= "https://learn.classdo.com/buildingblocs/">here</a>!
